# KU Project Manager
This is an open-source CRUD web application I developed, as part of my final year university course work. It aims to create a better experience for university students.


## To run:
Navigate to the project folder in terminal/command prompt and run the following comand:

> npm run start
Or
> yarn start

#### Note: make sure you have NodeJS installed
